# Persist.db

Persist.db is a simple gem that allows you to painlessly save Ruby Objects in a NoSQL persistent file store.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'persist'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself:

    $ gem install persist
    
*Requires Ruby 1.9 or newer.

## Usage

Example in Pry (or IRB if you must):

```ruby
require 'persist'
  #=> true

Persist.db
 # => #<PStore:0x007f8c199c9698
   @abort=false,
   @filename=".db.pstore",
   @lock=#<Mutex:0x007f8c199c9580>,
   @rdonly=true,
   @table={},
   @thread_safe=true,
   @ultra_safe=true>
  
Persist[:pie] = ['Key Lime', 'Strawberry Rhubarb', 'Blackberry Cobbler']
  # => ["Key Lime", "Strawberry Rhubarb", "Blackberry Cobbler"]
```

You can now quit IRB and your store will persist!

```ruby
require 'persist'
  #=> true
  
Persist.db
  #=> #<PStore:0x007f8c199c9698 ... >
  
Persist[:pie]
  #=> ["Key Lime", "Strawberry Rhubarb", "Blackberry Cobbler"]
```

TODO: Document Persist.db's other public methods such as #transaction, #delete, #path, #key? and #keys. The best documentation in the meanwhile is in the code itself: https://github.com/Havenwood/persist/blob/master/lib/persist/persist.rb

## Is It Production Readyâ„¢?
No. Persist.db is early Alpha, but please try it out and let me know if you find any bugs or real-world performance problems.
